       <Label Text="On the promontory of the marina, ‘Taking Flight’ is a sequence of sculptures which shows the different stages as a cormorant takes off across the Wear. Craig Knowles’ statue features four steel girders graded in order of increasing height as they near the water, atop of which is a cormorant gradually emerging and taking flight. Knowles regarded this as a metaphor to show the emergence of St Peter’s from an area of industrialisation to one that was closer to nature."
