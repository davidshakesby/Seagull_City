         <Label Text="The narrow river mouth, and consequent deep river bed, had made Sunderland an ideal location for shipbuilding since medieval times. The discovery of vast coal reserves in the area in the 18th century fuelled the industrialisation of the river at this point. During the 19th century, the river became an industrial power house of shipbuilders, collieries and glass manufacturers. By 1900, Sunderland was being described as the ‘greatest shipbuilding town in the world’, but by the end of the century, all of this vast industrial might had more or less vanished."
